# Learn Python the Hard Way

This repository will hold the code I produce while making my way through [Learn Python the Hard way by Zed A. Shaw](http://www.learnpythonthehardway.com).

Things will, in general, follow what's laid out in the book (including most study drills), but I may also make additions and adjustments according to my whims and interests.

Sometimes I will attempt to rewrite exercises to [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) standards.
