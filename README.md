# Learn Python Three the Hard Way

This repository will hold the code I produce while making my way through [Learn Python the Hard way by Zed A. Shaw](learnpythonthehardway.com).

Things will, in general, follow what's laid out in the book (including study drills), but all code will be written in [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/). I may also make additions and adjustments according to my whims and interests.
