# Learn Python the Hard Way

This repository will hold the code I produce while making my way through [Learn Python the Hard way by Zed A. Shaw](learnpythonthehardway.com).

Things will, in general, follow what's laid out in the book, but I will make additions and adjustments according to my whims and interests.

I just might rewrite everything in Python 3!
